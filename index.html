                    <p>I am currently pursuing my Master's in Financial Mathematics at The London School of Economics. Recently, I completed my Ph.D. In Deep Learning at Queen‚Äôs University in Kingston, Ontario at the L1NNA Laboratory. These areas, Finance and Deep Learning, reflect my love of mathematics, which is also why I chose to focus on math and statistics while achieving my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at Queen's. Throughout my career I had the pleasure of working in many different environments, from hedge fund R&#38;D, robotics programming, security research, and even house construction. I have a wide variety of skills that I use to solve all problems that I see in front of me.
                    If you would like a more detailed overview of my past work and education experience you may refer to my resume linked below.</p>

                    <h4>üî™ CaFK</h4>
                    <p>How to Catch a Falling Knife is a case study exploring a volatility-driven trading strategy designed to capitalize on sharp market downturns. Leveraging a combination of shorting the market during volatility spikes and buying underperforming stocks for mean reversion, the strategy is benchmarked through backtests from 2010 to 2024. The project evaluates three portfolio variants‚ÄîAbsolute Return, Market Sharpe, and Alpha Funds‚Äîeach tuned for different investor goals.

                    <h4>üí• Ch4os</h4>
                    <p>In this work, we propose Ch4os, a malware modification system trained in a Generative Adversarial Network setting. We introduce the Valid Machine Code Execution (VaME) activation function, guaranteeing functionality of modified malware samples while preserving differentiability of the learning process. As well, to address the challenge of learning efficiency and stability, we introduce the Binary Copier Pre-training (BCP) method. We conduct experiments on a dataset of chronologically separated malware for a simulated real-world detection scenario and show Ch4os can generate 152% more evasive samples compared to the state-of-the-art.

                    <p>We propose Mecha, a Neural-Symbolic Machine Learning (ML) system for malware variant matching and zero-day family detection. Mecha is comprised of an embedding network trained in two different scenarios for byte string embedding and an open-set approximate nearest neighbour algorithm for variant matching and zero-day detection. Our embedding network uses triplet loss for embedding generation and reinforcement-based Expectation Maximization (EM) learning for full deployment optimization. We conduct multiple in-sample and out-of-sample experiments to demonstrate the model's generalizability toward novel variants and families. We also show that Mecha can detect samples outside the known set of malware samples with an accuracy greater than 0.990 The publication can be found <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10847580" target="_blank" class="">here</a>.</p>

                    <h4>üì∑ Viz</h4>
                    <p>In this work, we propose the first practical and efficient solution for zero-day malware variant matching with reconstruction, Viz. By combining multi-modality learning and a Siamese-based structure, our model can navigate across different modalities and match zero-day variants. To address the missing or noisy modality issue, we propose a Conditional Variable Autoencoder with a Generative Adversarial Network for heightened resolution.

                    <p>H4RM0NY is a two player game for malware generation and detection.  H4RM0NY automates the process of obfuscating malware through a two party game using an OpenAI Gym. As its name suggests, H4RM0NY is not all evil, but we have seen that playing this game also strengthens malware detection networks against adversarial samples!

Using phenotypes allows us to skip over time consuming sandboxing, as well as store small and searchable information about malware samples. JARV1S has been published in the 14th International Conference on Cyber Conflict.

Temple stamps are written in a stamp book (Âæ°Êú±Âç∞Â∏≥) by monks or other artistis who work at that specific shrine. We traveled to Tokyo, Hakone, and Kyoto collecting stamps while site seeing, shopping, and having great food!
